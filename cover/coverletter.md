\today

To whom it may concern:

I have recently (May 2020) graduated with a Ph.D from the CSE department at Georgia Insitute of Technology where I worked primarily on high-performance computing for large-scale inverse problems. More specifically, my research focused on high-performance software solutions and algorithms for geophysical inverse problems, in particual wave-equation based seismic inversion and imaging. This research area involved multiple fields such as programming (Python, Julia, Matlab, C, MPI, OpenMP, OpenAcc, Pytorch), high-level abstraction for computational physics (Domain-specific languages and code generation for finite-difference simulations) with the developemnt of Devito,Cloud Computing (AWS, Azure), applied mathematics, and machine learning. Throughout my PhD and my current postodoctoral appointment, I have committed to open science and to the development of high level abstractions for scalable HPC software enabling research for domain specialists. I have primarily developped these software in Python and Julia, two languages well suited for abstracted saoftware development while still enabling performance through code generation and just-in-time compilation. Additionally, I have been working in the past two years on applying and extendind seismic imaging methods to photoacoustic imaging and carbon storage and sequestration monitoring. These new axis of research have broaden my knowledge of inverse problems and machine learning augmented physical inversion.

I believe that my experience and skills would be a great addition to ORNL. My collaborators and former supervisors can attest that I would be a valuable addition to the research team with my work ethic, productivity, and the skills I developed and perfected during my training as a student and now an independent researcher.

It would be a privilege to have the opportunity to discuss in more detail this opportunity at your earlier convenience. 
Thank you for your time.
