# resume

My resume and cover letter with markdown adapted from different repos.

## Changes

Modified links rendering to something a bit more conventional and natural.

Added citeproc processing of the full list of publication. The `cv/make_resume` fetches my publications as a bibtex file from my lab website, so you should modify it to use your own bibex file.
